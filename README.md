## About Me
- 🎓 Education:
  - B.A. in Physics at the University of Chicago (Grad 2024)
  - M.S. in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago (Grad 2025)
- 👩🏻‍💼 Work: Part-time Product Analyst for Award Winning Energy Forecasting Solutions Startup, [Amperon Inc.](https://www.amperon.co/)
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her

I'm a data scientist passionate about shaping a resilient, data-driven energy future. With a background in physics and data science, I am most interested in time series forecasting—where accuracy meets interpretability—to uncover the "why" behind energy trends.

⚡ My work focuses on:
- Forecasting electricity demand & peak load patterns
- Modeling climate-driven disruptions in energy systems
- Translating uncertainty into actionable insights

🌎 I care about the intersections of:
- Energy infrastructure
- Climate risk
- Load forecasting & planning

🎵 Outside the terminal:
I'm an avid runner, music lover, and systems thinker who finds joy in spotting subtle patterns—whether in the weather or a jazz solo.

## 📂 Featured Projects
