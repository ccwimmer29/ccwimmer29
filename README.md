## About Me
- 🎓 Education:
  - B.A. in Physics at the University of Chicago (Grad 2024)
  - M.S. in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago (Grad 2025)
- 👩🏻‍💼 Work: Part-time Product Analyst for Award Winning Energy Forecasting Solutions Startup, [Amperon Inc.](https://www.amperon.co/)
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her

I'm a data scientist passionate about shaping a resilient, data-driven energy future. With a background in physics and data science, I am most interested in time series forecasting—where accuracy meets interpretability—to uncover the "why" behind energy trends.

⚡ My work focuses on:
- Forecasting electricity demand & peak load patterns
- Modeling climate-driven disruptions in energy systems
- Translating uncertainty into actionable insights

🌎 I care about the intersections of:
- Energy infrastructure
- Climate risk
- Load forecasting & planning

🎵 Outside the terminal:
I'm an avid runner, music lover, and systems thinker who finds joy in spotting subtle patterns—whether in the weather or a jazz solo.

## 📂 Featured Projects
### [🌾 Crop Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/your-username/crop-yield-prediction)
**Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, PCA, SVR, Random Forest, GridSearchCV  
A machine learning model that forecasts crop yield using weather, soil, and pesticide data across 101 countries and 23 years. Achieved R² = 0.98 with Random Forest. Designed to support sustainable farming and resource optimization.

### 🌀 Hurricane Sandy Data Sonification | Personal Passion Project
*Exploring the intersection of art, science, and environmental memory.*

After witnessing the devastation of Hurricane Sandy firsthand growing up near the Jersey Shore, I wanted to find a way to translate that experience into music. Inspired by my undergraduate course *Music and Environment* and the works of John Luther Adams, I collected NOAA meteorological data from the storm and mapped it to MIDI notes in the E minor scale. Through this project, I created a musical portrait of the storm's approach, blending environmental data with sound to tell a story of nature’s beauty, force, and fragility. This project reflects my passion for using creative technologies to reconnect with the environment and explore new forms of storytelling.

## 🧠 Current Interests

- Energy forecasting under climate uncertainty
- Scalable cloud analytics pipelines (GCP, Azure)
- Real-world machine learning interpretability
- Merging music & data for creative exploration
