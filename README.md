## About Me
- ðŸŽ“ Education: B.A. in Physics and current M.S. in Applied Data Science candidate at the University of Chicago
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her

I'm a data scientist passionate about shaping a resilient, data-driven energy future. With a background in physics and data science, I specialize in time series forecastingâ€”where accuracy meets interpretabilityâ€”to uncover the "why" behind energy trends.

âš¡ My work focuses on:
- Forecasting electricity demand & peak load patterns
- Modeling climate-driven disruptions in energy systems
- Translating uncertainty into actionable insights

ðŸŒŽ I care about the intersections of:
- Energy infrastructure
- Climate risk
- Load forecasting & planning

ðŸŽµ Outside the terminal:
I'm an avid runner, music lover, and systems thinker who finds joy in spotting subtle patternsâ€”whether in the weather or a jazz solo.
